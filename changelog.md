## Notice for KSU/APatch Users:
- This module is may have compatibility issues with these root methods, it is recommended to use [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) as your primary root method to use this module efficiently as it was built for magisk anyways, i have never tested this module on these root methods so if you do choose to continue be sure to install a anti boot loop module to save your butt when you need it i am not responsible for anything that happens, use this at your own risk!
